                On 12 April 1961, at 6:07 am UTC, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome.

The radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:

              <blockquote class="quote">
                <p>
                  <strong>Korolev: </strong>
                  Preliminary stage ... intermediate... main... LIFT-OFF! We wish you a good flight. Everything's all right.
                  </br>
                  <strong>Gagarin: </strong>
                  Off we go! Goodbye, until [we meet] soon, dear friends.
